# Feedback application

Udemy course project to learn React

## Live demo

[Feedback app](https://snazzy-marshmallow-35d4a9.netlify.app/)

## Details

This is an app to create, update and delete feedback. It also calculates rating and shows all the feedback entries.

It is a part of the [React Front to Back Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-front-to-back-2022/).

I've also restructured this project and made a similar tasks tracking application: [repo](https://github.com/Dimterion/Tasks-app), [live demo](https://tasks-app-hazel.vercel.app/).

## Built with

React, React Router, Prettier
